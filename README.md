### description

This web application helps to solve the problem of of pet owners lacking the time and/or resources necessary to fulfill the attention and stimulation quota their furry friends require on the daily. These services are indeed very essential especially in the bid to curb the locking of pets in balconies- something that is extremely rampant in Nairobi suburbs.
This application is not only beneficial to pets, it is also a very handy tool for pet owners since it enables them to do thier work without the guilt of not having enough time to cater for their pets. 
In addition to this web application's ability to ensure the overall well-being of pets, it also has an event scheduler that allows for owner-pet bonding over fun-filled weekend activities. 

Go ahead and try Paw-Patrons today, your furball will thank us, & so will you! Tell a friend to tell a friend :)
